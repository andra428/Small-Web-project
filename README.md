# First Part - a simple website

This is a simple application with a Python backend server and a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The backend uses Python libraries to manage sockets and file manipulation, while the frontend handles the user interface.


### Backend Installation

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. The following Python libraries are required:

- `socket` 
- `os` 
- `json` 
- `gzip` 
- `io` 

These are all built-in Python libraries.

### Frontend Installation

The frontend doesn't require any external libraries. Simply open the `index.html` file in a browser to view the application.

## Usage

This application serves as a good example of basic web development concepts, where the frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side) work together to provide a functional web application.

# Second Part

This is a more complex web application built with Node.js, allowing users to browse and purchase various photo-related items (such as cameras, lenses, and accessories). The app also includes a survey feature for user interaction. The application uses an SQLite database to store data and various Node.js libraries to handle sessions, cookies, and user authentication.

### Installation

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your system. If you don't have them, you can download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- SQLite installed for database management.

#### Install Dependencies

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the following libraries:
- `body-parser`  - A middleware to parse incoming request bodies
- `cookie-parser`- A middleware to parse cookies
- `ejs` -  Templating engine to render views with dynamic content
- `express` - A web framework for building the server and handling routes
- `express-ejs-layouts` - A module to use layouts in EJS templates
- `express-session` - Middleware to manage user sessions
- `sqlite3` - SQLite database driver to interact with the database

## Usage
### Backend 

The backend is built with Node.js and uses the Express framework. It handles routing, session management, and database interactions.

- SQLite Database - the app uses SQLite to store product information
- Sessions and Cookies - express-session and cookie-parser are used to manage user sessions, allowing users to log in, track their purchases
- Security - a random secret key generated by crypto is used for secure session handling, ensuring that user sessions are protected

### Frontend

The frontend of the app uses EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templating to dynamically render pages. The layout is structured using the express-ejs-layouts package, and users can interact with the app using simple HTML forms for adding products to their cart, filling out the survey.

The main features of the app include:

- Product Catalog: Displaying photo-related items (cameras, lenses, etc.)
- Cart Functionality: Users can add products to the cart
- Survey Form: Users can fill out a photography-related survey
- User Login and Authentication: Users can register, log in, and manage their sessions securely

### Running the app
```bash
node app.js
```
